# Student-Category-on-Finite-State-Automata
A Secure web application where student category will be classified on using finite state automata.

A secure web application that requires the brief information about the students student rollno , name, address, travel time, study time, free time and the test marks that 
student has performed. Based on the details provided the passing probability of the student is computed and thus displayed. The logic behind the working of the application
makes use of finite state automata.
